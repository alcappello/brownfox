# Brownfox is a simple WYSIWYG Markdown editor

This project is just a playground for me to learn Angular 4 and to create something reusable. It's far from being complete: at the moment it's barely working!   

I hope that one day Brownfox will become a NPM package, so everyone who needs it can quickly install it and use it.

### There's a lot more to do!

If you feel like you want to contribuite to my small project, here's a list of features that I need to develop next:

- Add some tests: the main goal now is to shift to [TDD](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Test-driven_development).
- Complete the set of [Markdown](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Markdown) rules (atm only bold is working);
